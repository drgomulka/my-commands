# my-commands
handy commands chooser with fzf

fzf needs to be installed separately


## install

Run this:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/drgomulka/my-commands.git ~/.dotfiles/my-commands
~/.dotfiles/my-commands/install_aliases.sh
```
## what does this do

The idea here is to use fzf to choose a command from a prepared list of commands and to run it. All that is needed is: fzf installed, one alias and one text file with the list of commands.
